#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains attribute/value pairs for configuring externalized strings
# in messages.conf.
#
# There is a messages.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To set custom
# configurations, place a messages.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. You
# must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
#
# For the full list of all messages that can be overridden, check out
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/messages.conf
#
# The full name of a message resource is component_key + ':' + message_key. 
# After a descriptive message key, append two underscores, and then use the 
# letters after the % in printf style formatting, surrounded by underscores.
#
# For example, assume the following message resource is defined:
# 
#   [COMPONENT:MSG_KEY__D_LU_S]
#   message = FunctionX returned %d, expected %lu.
#   action  = See %s for details.
#
# The message key expected 3 printf style arguments (%d, %lu, %s), which can be 
# in either the message or action fields but mist appear in the same order.
#
# In addition to the printf style arguments above, some custom UI patterns are 
# allowed in the message and action fields. These patterns will be rendered by 
# the UI before displaying the text.
#
# For example, linking to a specific Splunk page can be done using this pattern:
# 
#   [COMPONENT:MSG_LINK__S]
#   message = License key '%s' is invalid.
#   action  = See [[/manager/system/licensing|Licensing]] for details.
#
# Another custom formatting option is for date/time arguments. If the argument 
# should be rendered in local time and formatted to a specific langauge, simply 
# provide the unix timestamp and prefix the printf style argument with "$t". 
# This will hint that the argument is actually a timestamp (not a number) and 
# should be formatted into a date/time string.
#
# The language and timezone used to render the timestamp is determined during 
# render time given the current user viewing the message - it is not required to 
# provide these details here.
#
# For example, assume the following message resource is defined:
# 
#   [COMPONENT:TIME_BASED_MSG__LD]
#   message = Component exception @ $t%ld.
#   action  = See splunkd.log for details.
#
# The first argument is prefixed with "$t", and therefore will be treated as a 
# unix timestamp. It will be formatted as a date/time string.
# 
# For these and other examples, check out 
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/README/messages.conf.example

############################################################################
# Component
############################################################################

[<component>]

name = <string>
* The human-readable name used to prefix all messages under this component
* Required

############################################################################
# Message
############################################################################

[<component>:<key>]

message = <string>
* The message string describing what and why something happened
* Required

message_alternate = <string>
* An alternative static string for this message
* Any arguments will be ignored
* Defaults to nothing

action = <string>
* The action string describing the next steps in reaction to the message
* Defaults to nothing

severity = critical|error|warn|info|debug
* The severity of the message
* Defaults to warn

capabilities = <capability list>
* The capabilities required to view the message, comma separated
* Defaults to nothing

roles = <role list>
* The roles required to view the message, comma separated. If a user
  belongs to any of these roles, the message will be visible to them.
* If a role scope is specified with this setting, it takes precedence over the
  "capabilities" setting, which is ignored for the message.
* Always unset by default in Splunk Enterprise. This settings should be manually
  configured with any system or user-created roles.

help = <location string>
* The location string to link users to specific documentation
* Defaults to nothing
