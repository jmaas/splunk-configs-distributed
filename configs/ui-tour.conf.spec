#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains the tours available for Splunk Onboarding
#
# There is a default ui-tour.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default. 
# To create custom tours, place a ui-tour.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. To create custom tours for an app, place
# ui-tour.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps/<app_name>/local/.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles
#
# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of
#     the file.
#   * This is not a typical conf file for configurations. It is used to set/create
#     tours to demonstrate product functionality to users.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.
