#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring
# authentication via authentication.conf.
#
# There is an authentication.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To
# set custom configurations, place an authentication.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see
# authentication.conf.example.  You must restart Splunk to enable
# configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[authentication]
* Follow this stanza name with any number of the following attribute/value
  pairs.

authType = [Splunk|LDAP|Scripted|SAML|ProxySSO]
* Specify which authentication system to use.
* Supported values: Splunk, LDAP, Scripted, SAML, ProxySSO.
* Defaults to Splunk.

authSettings = <authSettings-key>,<authSettings-key>,...
* Key to look up the specific configurations of chosen authentication
  system.
* <authSettings-key> is the name of a stanza header that specifies
  attributes for scripted authentication, SAML, ProxySSO and for an LDAP
  strategy. Those stanzas are defined below.
* For LDAP, specify the LDAP strategy name(s) here. If you want Splunk to
  query multiple LDAP servers, enter a comma-separated list of all
  strategies. Each strategy must be defined in its own stanza. The order in
  which you specify the strategy names will be the order Splunk uses to
  query their servers when looking for a user.
* For scripted authentication, <authSettings-key> should be a single 
  stanza name.

passwordHashAlgorithm = [SHA512-crypt|SHA256-crypt|SHA512-crypt-<num_rounds>|SHA256-crypt-<num_rounds>|MD5-crypt]
* For the default "Splunk" authType, this controls how hashed passwords are
  stored in the $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/passwd file.
* "MD5-crypt" is an algorithm originally developed for FreeBSD in the early
  1990's which became a widely used standard among UNIX machines.  It was
  also used by Splunk up through the 5.0.x releases.  MD5-crypt runs the
  salted password through a sequence of 1000 MD5 operations.
* "SHA256-crypt" and "SHA512-crypt" are newer versions that use 5000 rounds
  of the SHA256 or SHA512 hash functions.  This is slower than MD5-crypt and
  therefore more resistant to dictionary attacks.  SHA512-crypt is used for
  system passwords on many versions of Linux.
* These SHA-based algorithm can optionally be followed by a number of rounds
  to use.  For example, "SHA512-crypt-10000" will use twice as many rounds
  of hashing as the default implementation.  The number of rounds must be at
  least 1000.
  If you specify a very large number of rounds (i.e. more than 20x the
  default value of 5000), splunkd may become unresponsive and connections to
  splunkd (from splunkweb or CLI) will time out.
* This setting only affects new password settings (either when a user is
  added or a user's password is changed)  Existing passwords will continue
  to work but retain their previous hashing algorithm.
* The default is "SHA512-crypt".

externalTwoFactorAuthVendor = <string>
* OPTIONAL.
* A valid Multifactor vendor string will enable Multifactor authentication
  and loads support for the corresponding vendor if supported by Splunk.
* Empty string will disable Multifactor authentication in splunk.
* Currently splunk supports duo as a Multifactor authentication vendor.

externalTwoFactorAuthSettings = <externalTwoFactorAuthSettings-key>
* OPTIONAL.
* Key to look up the specific configuration of chosen Multifactor
  authentication vendor.

# LDAP settings
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the attribute/value pairs listed below.
* For multiple strategies, you will need to specify multiple instances of
  this stanza, each with its own stanza name and a separate set of
  attributes.
* The <authSettings-key> must be one of the values listed in the
  authSettings attribute, specified above in the [authentication] stanza.

host = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the hostname of LDAP server.
* Be sure that your Splunk server can resolve the host name.

SSLEnabled = [0|1]
* OPTIONAL
* Defaults to disabled (0)
* See the file $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/openldap/ldap.conf for SSL LDAP settings

port = <integer>
* OPTIONAL
* This is the port that Splunk should use to connect to your LDAP server.
* Defaults to port 389 for non-SSL and port 636 for SSL

bindDN = <string>
* OPTIONAL, leave this blank to retrieve your LDAP entries using
  anonymous bind (must be supported by the LDAP server)
* Distinguished name of the user that will be retrieving the LDAP entries
* This user must have read access to all LDAP users and groups you wish to
  use in Splunk.

bindDNpassword = <password>
* OPTIONAL, leave this blank if anonymous bind is sufficient
* Password for the bindDN user.

userBaseDN = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain the users
* Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.

userBaseFilter = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* This is the LDAP search filter you wish to use when searching for users.
* Highly recommended, especially when there are many entries in your LDAP
  user subtrees
* When used properly, search filters can significantly speed up LDAP queries
* Example that matches users in the IT or HR department:
    * userBaseFilter = (|(department=IT)(department=HR))
    * See RFC 2254 for more detailed information on search filter syntax
* This defaults to no filtering.

userNameAttribute = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the user entry attribute whose value is the username.
* NOTE: This attribute should use case insensitive matching for its values,
  and the values should not contain whitespace
    * Usernames are case insensitive in Splunk
* In Active Directory, this is 'sAMAccountName'
* A typical attribute for this is 'uid'

realNameAttribute = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the user entry attribute whose value is their real name 
  (human readable).
* A typical attribute for this is 'cn'

emailAttribute = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* This is the user entry attribute whose value is their email address.
* Defaults to 'mail'

groupMappingAttribute  = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* This is the user entry attribute whose value is used by group entries to
  declare membership.
* Groups are often mapped with user DN, so this defaults to 'dn'
* Set this if groups are mapped using a different attribute
  * Usually only needed for OpenLDAP servers.
  * A typical attribute used to map users to groups is 'uid'
    * For example, assume a group declares that one of its members is
      'splunkuser'
    * This implies that every user with 'uid' value 'splunkuser' will be
      mapped to that group

groupBaseDN = [<string>;<string>;...]
* REQUIRED
* This is the distinguished names of LDAP entries whose subtrees contain 
  the groups.
* Enter a ';' delimited list to search multiple trees.
* If your LDAP environment does not have group entries, there is a
  configuration that can treat each user as its own group
  * Set groupBaseDN to the same as userBaseDN, which means you will search
    for groups in the same place as users
  * Next, set the groupMemberAttribute and groupMappingAttribute to the same
    attribute as userNameAttribute
    * This means the entry, when treated as a group, will use the username
      value as its only member
  * For clarity, you should probably also set groupNameAttribute to the same
    value as userNameAttribute as well

groupBaseFilter = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* The LDAP search filter Splunk uses when searching for static groups
* Like userBaseFilter, this is highly recommended to speed up LDAP queries
* See RFC 2254 for more information
* This defaults to no filtering

dynamicGroupFilter = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* The LDAP search filter Splunk uses when searching for dynamic groups
* Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your LDAP server
* Example: '(objectclass=groupOfURLs)'

dynamicMemberAttribute = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* Only configure this if you intend to retrieve dynamic groups on your
  LDAP server
* This is REQUIRED if you want to retrieve dynamic groups
* This attribute contains the LDAP URL needed to retrieve members dynamically
* Example: 'memberURL'

groupNameAttribute = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the group entry attribute whose value stores the group name.
* A typical attribute for this is 'cn' (common name)
* Recall that if you are configuring LDAP to treat user entries as their own
  group, user entries must have this attribute

groupMemberAttribute = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the group entry attribute whose values are the groups members
* Typical attributes for this are 'member' and 'memberUid'
* For example, consider the groupMappingAttribute example above using
  groupMemberAttribute 'member'
  * To declare 'splunkuser' as a group member, its attribute 'member' must
    have the value 'splunkuser'

nestedGroups = <bool>
* OPTIONAL
* Controls whether Splunk will expand nested groups using the
  'memberof' extension.
* Set to 1 if you have nested groups you want to expand and the 'memberof'
* extension on your LDAP server.

charset = <string>
* OPTIONAL
* ONLY set this for an LDAP setup that returns non-UTF-8 encoded data. LDAP
  is supposed to always return UTF-8 encoded data (See RFC 2251), but some
  tools incorrectly return other encodings.
* Follows the same format as CHARSET in props.conf (see props.conf.spec)
* An example value would be "latin-1"

anonymous_referrals = <bool>
* OPTIONAL
* Set this to 0 to turn off referral chasing
* Set this to 1 to turn on anonymous referral chasing
* IMPORTANT: We only chase referrals using anonymous bind. We do NOT support
  rebinding using credentials.
* If you do not need referral support, we recommend setting this to 0
* If you wish to make referrals work, set this to 1 and ensure your server
  allows anonymous searching
* Defaults to 1

sizelimit = <integer>
* OPTIONAL
* Limits the amount of entries we request in LDAP search
* IMPORTANT: The max entries returned is still subject to the maximum
  imposed by your LDAP server
  * Example: If you set this to 5000 and the server limits it to 1000,
             you'll still only get 1000 entries back
* Defaults to 1000

timelimit = <integer>
* OPTIONAL
* Limits the amount of time in seconds we will wait for an LDAP search
  request to complete
* If your searches finish quickly, you should lower this value from the
  default
* Defaults to 15 seconds
* Maximum value is 30 seconds

network_timeout = <integer>
* OPTIONAL
* Limits the amount of time a socket will poll a connection without activity
* This is useful for determining if your LDAP server cannot be reached
* IMPORTANT: As a connection could be waiting for search results, this value
             must be higher than 'timelimit'
* Like 'timelimit', if you have a fast connection to your LDAP server, we
  recommend lowering this value
* Defaults to 20

#####################
# Map roles
#####################

[roleMap_<authSettings-key>]
* The mapping of Splunk roles to LDAP groups for the LDAP strategy specified
  by <authSettings-key>
* IMPORTANT: this role mapping ONLY applies to the specified strategy.
* Follow this stanza name with several Role-to-Group(s) mappings as defined
  below.
* Note: Importing groups for the same user from different strategies is not 
  supported.

<Splunk RoleName> = <LDAP group string>
* Maps a Splunk role (from authorize.conf) to LDAP groups
* This LDAP group list is semicolon delimited (no spaces).
* List several of these attribute value pairs to map several Splunk roles to
  LDAP Groups

#####################
# Scripted authentication
#####################

[<authSettings-key>]
* Follow this stanza name with the following attribute/value pairs:

scriptPath = <string>
* REQUIRED
* This is the full path to the script, including the path to the program
  that runs it (python)
* For example: "$SPLUNK_HOME/bin/python" "$SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/bin/$MY_SCRIPT"
* Note: If a path contains spaces, it must be quoted. The example above
  handles the case where SPLUNK_HOME contains a space

scriptSearchFilters = [1|0]
* OPTIONAL - Only set this to 1 to call the script to add search filters.
* 0 disables (default)

[cacheTiming]
* Use these settings to adjust how long Splunk will use the answers returned
  from script functions before calling them again.

userLoginTTL = <time range string>
* Timeout for the userLogin script function.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* The default is '0' (no caching)

getUserInfoTTL = <time range string>
* Timeout for the getUserInfo script function.
* These return values are cached on a per-user basis.
* The default is '10s'

getUsersTTL = <time range string>
* Timeout for the getUsers script function.
* There is only one global getUsers cache (it is not tied to a
  specific user).
* The default is '10s'

* All timeouts can be expressed in seconds or as a search-like time range
* Examples include '30' (30 seconds), '2mins' (2 minutes), '24h' (24 hours), etc.
* You can opt to use no caching for a particular function by setting the
  value to '0'
  * Be aware that this can severely hinder performance as a result of heavy
    script invocation
* Choosing the correct values for cache timing involves a tradeoff between
  new information latency and general performance
  * High values yield better performance from calling the script less, but
    introduces a latency in picking up changes
  * Low values will pick up changes in your external auth system more
    quickly, but may slow down performance due to increased script
    invocations

  present, splunk will use the ssl setting for splunkweb.
* Splunk will use this information to populate the 'assertionConsumerServiceUrl'.

redirectPort = <port number>
* OPTIONAL
* The port where SAML responses will be sent. Typically, this is the
  web port.
* If internal port redirection is needed, set this port and the
  'assertionconsumerServiceUrl' in the AuthNRequest will contain this port
  instead of the splunkweb port.
* To prevent any port information to be appended in the
  'assertionConsumerServiceUrl' attribute, set this to 0.

idpSSOUrl = <url>
* REQUIRED
* The protocol endpoint on the IDP (Identity Provider) where the
  AuthNRequests should be sent.
* SAML requests will fail if this information is missing.

idpAttributeQueryUrl = <url>
* OPTIONAL
* The protocol endpoint on the IDP (Identity Provider) where the attribute
  query requests should be sent.
* Attribute queries can be used to get the latest 'role' information,
  if there is support for Attribute queries on the IDP.
* When this setting is absent, Splunk will cache the role information from the saml
  assertion and use it to run saved searches.

idpCertPath = <Pathname>
* OPTIONAL
* This setting is required if 'signedAssertion' is set to true.
* This value is relative to $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/idpCerts.
* The value for this setting can be the name of the certificate file or a directory.
* If it is empty, Splunk will automatically verify with certificates in all subdirectories
  present in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/auth/idpCerts.
* If the saml response is to be verified with a IDP (Identity Provider) certificate that
  is self signed, then this setting holds the filename of the certificate.
* If the saml response is to be verified with a certificate that is a part of a
  certificate chain(root, intermediate(s), leaf), create a subdirectory and place the
  certificate chain as files in the subdirectory.
* If there are multiple end certificates, create a subdirectory such that, one subdirectory
  holds one certificate chain.
* If multiple such certificate chains are present, the assertion is considered verified,
  if validation succeeds with any certifcate chain.
* The file names within a certificate chain should be such that root certificate is alphabetically
  before the intermediate which is alphabetically before of the end cert.
  ex. cert_1.pem has the root, cert_2.pem has the first intermediate cert, cert_3.pem has the second
      intermediate certificate and cert_4.pem has the end certificate.

  The value of this setting corresponds to attribute "entityID" of
  "EntityDescriptor" node in IdP metadata document.
* If you configure SAML using IdP metadata, this field will be extracted from
  the metadata.
* If you configure SAML manually, then you must configure this setting.
* When Splunk software tries to verify the SAML response, the issuerId
  specified here must match the 'Issuer' field in the SAML response. Otherwise,
  validation of the SAML response will fail.

signAuthnRequest = [ true | false ]
* OPTIONAL
* This tells Splunk whether to sign AuthNRequests.
* Defaults to true.

signedAssertion = [true|false]
* OPTIONAL
* This tells Splunk if the SAML assertion has been signed by the IDP
* If set to false, Splunk will not verify the signature of the assertion
  using the certificate of the IDP.

* If this is not specified and a idpSLO is also missing, the user will be
  redirected to splunk.com after logout.

defaultRoleIfMissing = <splunk role>
* OPTIONAL
* If the IDP does not return any AD groups or splunk roles as a part of the
  assertion, we will use this value if provided.

skipAttributeQueryRequestForUsers = <comma separated list of users>
* OPTIONAL
* To skip attribute query requests being sent to the IDP for certain users,
  add them here.
* By default, attribute query requests will be skipped for local users.
* For non-local users, use this in conjunction with 'defaultRoleIfMissing'.

maxAttributeQueryThreads = <int>
* OPTIONAL
* Defaults to 2, max is 10
* Number of threads to use to make attribute query requests.
* Changes to this will require a restart to take effect.

maxAttributeQueryQueueSize = <int>

* If set to true, the server will allow clients to negotiate SSL-layer 
  data compression.
* If not set, defaults to the setting in server.conf.

cipherSuite = <cipher suite string>
* OPTIONAL
* If set, Splunk uses the specified cipher string for the HTTP server.
* If not set, defaults to the setting in server.conf.
* Attribute query requests might fail if the IDP requires a relaxed
  ciphersuite.
* Use "openssl s_client -cipher 'TLSv1+HIGH:@STRENGTH' -host <IDP host> -port 443" 
  to determine if splunk can connect to the IDP

sslVersions = <versions_list>
* OPTIONAL
* Comma-separated list of SSL versions to support.
* The versions available are "ssl3", "tls1.0", "tls1.1", and "tls1.2"
* If not set, defaults to the setting in server.conf.

sslCommonNameToCheck = <commonName>
* OPTIONAL
* If this value is set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
  splunkd will limit most outbound HTTPS connections to hosts which use
  a cert with this common name.
* If not set, Splunk uses the setting specified in server.conf.

sslAltNameToCheck = <alternateName1>, <alternateName2>, ...
* OPTIONAL
* If this value is set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
