#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for saved search entries in
# savedsearches.conf.  You can configure saved searches by creating your own
# savedsearches.conf.
#
# There is a default savedsearches.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default. To
# set custom configurations, place a savedsearches.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/.  For examples, see
# savedsearches.conf.example. You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see the
# documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#  * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top of
#    the file.
#  * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#    multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of multiple
#    definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the file wins.
#  * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#    stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

#*******
# The possible attribute/value pairs for savedsearches.conf are:
#*******

[<stanza name>]
* Create a unique stanza name for each saved search.
* Follow the stanza name with any number of the following attribute/value
  pairs.
* If you do not specify an attribute, Splunk uses the default.

disabled = [0|1]
* Disable your search by setting to 1.
* A disabled search cannot run until it is enabled.
* This setting is typically used to keep a scheduled search from running on
  its schedule without deleting the search definition.
* Defaults to 0.

search = <string>
* Actual search terms of the saved search.
* For example, search = index::sampledata http NOT 500.
* Your search can include macro searches for substitution.
* To learn more about creating a macro search, search the documentation for
  "macro search."
* Multi-line search strings currently have some limitations.  For example use
  with the search command '|savedseach' does not currently work with multi-line
  search strings.
* Defaults to empty string.

dispatchAs = [user|owner]
* When the saved search is dispatched via the "saved/searches/{name}/dispatch"
  endpoint, this setting controls, what user that search is dispatched as.
* This setting is only meaningful for shared saved searches.
* When dispatched as user it will be executed as if the requesting user owned
  the search.
* When dispatched as owner it will be executed as if the owner of the search
  dispatched it no matter what user requested it.
* If the 'force_saved_search_dispatch_as_user' attribute, in the limits.conf
  file, is set to true then the dispatchAs attribute is reset to 'user' while
  the saved search is dispatching.
* Defaults to owner.


#*******
# Scheduling options
#*******

enableSched = [0|1]
* Set this to 1 to run your search on a schedule.
* Defaults to 0.

cron_schedule = <cron string>
* The cron schedule used to execute this search.
* For example: */5 * * * *  causes the search to execute every 5 minutes.
* Cron lets you use standard cron notation to define your scheduled search
  interval.
  In particular, cron can accept this type of notation: 00,20,40 * * * *, which
  runs the search every hour at hh:00, hh:20, hh:40. Along the same lines, a
  cron of 03,23,43 * * * * runs the search every hour at hh:03, hh:23, hh:43.
* Splunk recommends that you schedule your searches so that they are staggered
  over time. This reduces system load. Running all of them every 20 minutes
  (*/20) means they would all launch at hh:00 (20, 40) and might slow your
  system every 20 minutes.
* Splunk's cron implementation does not currently support names of months/days.
* Defaults to empty string.

schedule = <cron-style string>
* This field is DEPRECATED as of 4.0.
* For more information, see the pre-4.0 spec file.
* Use cron_schedule to define your scheduled search interval.

allow_skew = <percentage>|<duration-specifier>
* Allows the search scheduler to randomly distribute scheduled searches more
  evenly over their periods.
* When set to non-zero for searches with the following cron_schedule values,
  the search scheduler randomly "skews" the second, minute, and hour that the
  search actually runs on:
    * * * * *     Every minute.
    */M * * * *   Every M minutes (M > 0).
    0 * * * *     Every hour.
    0 */H * * *   Every H hours (H > 0).
    0 0 * * *     Every day (at midnight).
* When set to non-zero for a search that has any other cron_schedule setting,
  the search scheduler can only randomly "skew" the second that the search runs
  on.
* The amount of skew for a specific search remains constant between edits of
  the search.
* An integer value followed by '%' (percent) specifies the maximum amount of
  time to skew as a percentage of the scheduled search period.
* Otherwise, use <int><unit> to specify a maximum duration.  Relevant units
  are: m, min, minute, mins, minutes, h, hr, hour, hrs, hours, d, day, days.
  (The <unit> may be omitted only when <int> is 0.)
* Examples:
    100% (for an every-5-minute search) = 5 minutes maximum
    50% (for an every-minute search) = 30 seconds maximum
    5m = 5 minutes maximum
    1h = 1 hour maximum
* A value of 0 disallows skew.
* Default is 0.

max_concurrent = <unsigned int>
* The maximum number of concurrent instances of this search the scheduler is
  allowed to run.
* Defaults to 1.

realtime_schedule = [0|1]
* Controls the way the scheduler computes the next execution time of a
  scheduled search.
* If this value is set to 1, the scheduler bases its determination of the next
  scheduled search execution time on the current time.
* If this value is set to 0, the scheduler bases its determination of the next
  scheduled search on the last search execution time. This is called continuous
  scheduling.
  * If set to 1, the scheduler might skip some execution periods to make sure
    that the scheduler is executing the searches running over the most recent
    time range.
  * If set to 0, the scheduler never skips scheduled execution periods.
  * However, the execution
    of the saved search might fall behind depending on the scheduler's load.
    Use continuous scheduling whenever you enable the summary index option.
* The scheduler tries to execute searches that have realtime_schedule set to 1
  before it executes searches that have continuous scheduling
  (realtime_schedule = 0).
* Defaults to 1

schedule_priority = default | higher | highest
* Raises scheduling priority of a search:
  + "default": No scheduling priority increase.
  + "higher": Scheduling priority is higher than other searches of the same
    scheduling tier. While there are four tiers of priority for scheduled
    searches, only the following are affected by this property:
    1. Real-Time-Scheduled (realtime_schedule=1).
    2. Continuous-Scheduled (realtime_schedule=0).
  + "highest": Scheduling priority is higher than other searches regardless of
    scheduling tier. However, real-time-scheduled searches with priority =
    highest always have priority over continuous scheduled searches with
    priority = highest.
  + Hence, the high-to-low order (where RTSS = real-time-scheduled search,
    CSS = continuous-scheduled search, d = default, h = higher, H = highest)
    is: RTSS(H) > CSS(H) > RTSS(h) > RTSS(d) > CSS(h) > CSS(d)
* The scheduler honors a non-default priority only when the search owner has
  the 'edit_search_schedule_priority' capability.
* Defaults to "default".
* A non-default priority is mutually exclusive with a non-zero 'schedule_window'
  (see below).  If a user specifies both for a scheduled search, the scheduler
  honors the priority only.
* However, if a user specifies both settings for a search, but the search owner
  does not have the 'edit_search_scheduler_priority' capability, then the
  scheduler ignores the priority setting and honors the 'schedule_window'.
* WARNING: Having too many searches with a non-default priority will impede the
  ability of the scheduler to minimize search starvation.  Use this setting
  only for mission-critical searches.

schedule_window = <unsigned int> | auto
* When schedule_window is non-zero, it indicates to the scheduler that the
  search does not require a precise start time. This gives the scheduler
  greater flexibility when it prioritizes searches.
* When schedule_window is set to an integer greater than 0, it specifies the
  "window" of time (in minutes) a search may start within.
  + The schedule_window must be shorter than the period of the search.
  + Schedule windows are not recommended for searches that run every minute.
* When set to 0, there is no schedule window. The scheduler starts the search
  as close to its scheduled time as possible.
* When set to "auto," the scheduler calculates the schedule_window value
  automatically.
  + For more information about this calculation, see the search scheduler
    documentation.
* Defaults to 0 for searches that are owned by users with the
  edit_search_schedule_window capability. For such searches, this value can be
  changed.
* Defaults to "auto" for searches that are owned by users that do not have the
  edit_search_window capability. For such searches, this setting cannot be
  changed.
* A non-zero schedule_window is mutually exclusive with a non-default
  schedule_priority (see schedule_priority for details).

  multiple of the scheduled search's execution period (e.g. if the search is
  scheduled to run hourly and ttl is set to 2p the ttl of the artifacts will be
  set to 2 hours).
* If an action is triggered Splunk changes the ttl to that action's ttl. If
  multiple actions are triggered, Splunk applies the largest action ttl to the
  artifacts. To set the action's ttl, refer to alert_actions.conf.spec.

embed.enabled = 0 | 1
* Specifies whether a saved search is shared for access with a guestpass.
* Search artifacts of a search can be viewed via a guestpass only if:
  * A token has been generated that is associated with this saved search.
    The token is associated with a particular user and app context.
  * The user to whom the token belongs has permissions to view that search.
  * The saved search has been scheduled and there are artifacts available.
    Only artifacts are available via guestpass: we never dispatch a search.
  * The save search is not disabled, it is scheduled, it is not real-time,
    and it is not an alert.

defer_scheduled_searchable_idxc = <bool>
* Specifies whether to defer a continuous saved search during a searchable rolling restart or searchable rolling upgrade of an indexer cluster.
