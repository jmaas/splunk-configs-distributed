#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file describes some of the settings that are used, and
# can be configured on a per-user basis for use by the Splunk Web UI.

# Settings in this file are requested with user and application scope of the
# relevant user, and the user-prefs app.

# Additionally, settings by the same name which are available in the roles
# the user belongs to will be used at lower precedence.

# This means interactive setting of these values will cause the values to be
# updated in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/users/<username>/user-prefs/local/user-prefs.conf where
# <username> is the username for the user altering their preferences.

# It also means that values in another app will never be used unless they
# are exported globally (to system scope) or to the user-prefs app.

# In practice, providing values in other apps isn't very interesting, since
# values from the authorize.conf roles settings are more typically sensible
# ways to defaults for values in user-prefs.
