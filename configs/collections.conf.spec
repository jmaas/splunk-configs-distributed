[<collection-name>]

enforceTypes = true|false
* Indicates whether to enforce data types when inserting data into the
  collection.
* When set to true, invalid insert operations fail.
* When set to false, invalid insert operations drop only the invalid field.
* Defaults to false.

field.<name> = number|bool|string|time
* Field type for a field called <name>.
* If the data type is not provided, it is inferred from the provided JSON
  data type.

accelerated_fields.<name> = <json>
* Acceleration definition for an acceleration called <name>.
* Must be a valid JSON document (invalid JSON is ignored).
* Example: 'acceleration.foo={"a":1, "b":-1}' is a compound acceleration
  that first sorts 'a' in ascending order and then 'b' in descending order.
* If multiple accelerations with the same definition are in the same
  collection, the duplicates are skipped.
* If the data within a field is too large for acceleration, you will see a
  warning when you try to create an accelerated field and the acceleration
  will not be created.
* An acceleration is always created on the _key.
* The order of accelerations is important. For example, an acceleration of
  { "a":1, "b":1 } speeds queries on "a" and "a" + "b", but not on "b"
   lone.
* Multiple separate accelerations also speed up queries. For example,
  separate accelerations { "a": 1 } and { "b": 1 } will speed up queries on
  "a" + "b", but not as well as a combined acceleration { "a":1, "b":1 }.
* Defaults to nothing (no acceleration).

profilingEnabled = true|false
* Indicates whether to enable logging of slow-running operations, as defined
  in 'profilingThresholdMs'.
* Defaults to false.

profilingThresholdMs = <zero or positive integer>
* The threshold for logging a slow-running operation, in milliseconds.
* When set to 0, all operations are logged.
* This setting is only used when 'profilingEnabled' is true.
* This setting impacts the performance of the collection.
* Defaults to 1000.

replicate = true|false
* Indicates whether to replicate this collection on indexers. When false,
  this collection is not replicated, and lookups that depend on this
  collection will not be available (although if you run a lookup command
  with 'local=true', local lookups will still be available). When true,
  this collection is replicated on indexers.
* Defaults to false.

replication_dump_strategy = one_file|auto
* Indicates how to store dump files. When set to one_file, dump files are
  stored in a single file. When set to auto, dumps are stored in multiple
  files when the size of the collection exceeds the value of
  'replication_dump_maximum_file_size'.
* Defaults to auto.

replication_dump_maximum_file_size = <unsigned integer>
* Specifies the maximum file size (in KB) for each dump file when
  'replication_dump_strategy=auto'.
* If this value is larger than 'concerningReplicatedFileSize', which is set
  in distsearch.conf, the value of 'concerningReplicatedFileSize' will be
  used instead.
* KV Store does not pre-calculate the size of the records that will be written
  to disk, so the size of the resulting files can be affected by the
  'max_rows_in_memory_per_dump' setting from 'limits.conf'.
* Defaults to 10240KB.

type = internal_cache|undefined
* Indicates the type of data that this collection holds.
* When set to 'internal_cache', changing the configuration of the current
  instance between search head cluster, search head pool, or standalone
  will erase the data in the collection.
* Defaults to 'undefined'.
* For internal use only.
