#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains possible attribute/value pairs for creating roles in
# authorize.conf.  You can configure roles and granular access controls by
# creating your own authorize.conf.

# There is an authorize.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/default/.  To set
# custom configurations, place an authorize.conf in
# $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/. For examples, see authorize.conf.example.
# You must restart Splunk to enable configurations.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in
#     the file wins.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[default]
srchFilterSelecting = <boolean>
* Determines whether a role's search filters will be used for selecting or
  eliminating during role inheritance.
* Selecting will join the search filters with an OR when combining the
  filters.
* Eliminating will join the search filters with an AND when combining the
  filters.
    * All roles will default to true (in other words, selecting).
* Example:
  * role1 srchFilter = sourcetype!=ex1 with selecting=true
  * role2 srchFilter = sourcetype=ex2 with selecting = false
  * role3 srchFilter = sourcetype!=ex3 AND index=main with selecting = true
  * role3 inherits from role2 and role 2 inherits from role1
  * Resulting srchFilter = ((sourcetype!=ex1) OR 
    (sourcetype!=ex3 AND index=main)) AND ((sourcetype=ex2))

[capability::<capability>]
* DO NOT edit, remove, or add capability stanzas. The existing capabilities
  are the full set of Splunk system capabilities.
* Splunk adds all of its capabilities this way
* For the default list of capabilities and assignments, see authorize.conf
  under the 'default' directory
* Only alphanumeric characters and "_" (underscore) are allowed in 
  capability names.
  Examples: 
  * edit_visualizations 
  * view_license1
* Descriptions of specific capabilities are listed below.

[role_<roleName>]
<capability> = <enabled>
* A capability that is enabled for this role.
* You can list many of these.
* Note that 'enabled' is the only accepted value here, as capabilities are
  disabled by default.
* Roles inherit all capabilities from imported roles, and inherited
  capabilities cannot be disabled.
* Role names cannot have uppercase characters. User names, however, are
  case-insensitive.

importRoles = <string>
* Semicolon delimited list of other roles and their associated capabilities
  that should be imported.
* Importing other roles also imports the other aspects of that role, such as
  allowed indexes to search.
* By default a role imports no other roles.

grantableRoles = <string>
* Semicolon delimited list of roles that can be granted when edit_user
  capability is present.
* By default, a role with edit_user capability can create/edit a user and
  assign any role to them. But when grantableRoles is present, the roles
  that can be assigned will be restricted to the ones provided.
* For a role that has no edit_user capability, grantableRoles has no effect.
* Defaults to not present.
* Example: grantableRoles = role1;role2;role3

srchFilter = <string>
* Semicolon delimited list of search filters for this Role.
* By default we perform no search filtering.
* To override any search filters from imported roles, set this to '*', as
  the 'admin' role does.

srchTimeWin = <number>
* Maximum time span of a search, in seconds.
    * This time window limit is applied backwards from the latest time
      specified in a search.
* By default, searches are not limited to any specific time window.
* To override any search time windows from imported roles, set this to '0'
  (infinite), as the 'admin' role does.
* -1 is a special value that implies no search window has been set for 
  this role
    * This is equivalent to not setting srchTimeWin at all, which means it
      can be easily overridden by an imported role

srchDiskQuota = <number>
* Maximum amount of disk space (MB) that can be used by search jobs of a
  user that belongs to this role
* In search head clustering environments, this setting takes effect on a 
  per-member basis. There is no cluster-wide accounting.
* The dispatch manager checks the quota at the dispatch time of a search
  and additionally the search process will check at intervals that are defined
  in the 'disk_usage_update_period' setting in limits.conf as long as the
  search is active.
* The quota can be exceeded at times, since the search process does not check
  the quota constantly.
* Exceeding this quota causes the search to be auto-finalized immediately,
  even if there are results that have not yet been returned.
* Defaults to '100', for 100 MB.

srchJobsQuota = <number>
* Maximum number of concurrently running historical searches a member of
  this role can have.
* This excludes real-time searches, see rtSrchJobsQuota.
* Defaults to 3.

rtSrchJobsQuota = <number>
* Maximum number of concurrently running real-time searches a member of this
  role can have.
* Defaults to 6.

srchMaxTime = <number><unit>
* Maximum amount of time that searches of users from this role will be
  allowed to run.
* Once the search has been ran for this amount of time it will be auto
  finalized, If the role
* Inherits from other roles, the maximum srchMaxTime value specified in the
  included roles.
* This maximum does not apply to real-time searches.
* Examples: 1h, 10m, 2hours, 2h, 2hrs, 100s
* Defaults to 100days

srchIndexesDefault = <string>
* A semicolon-delimited list of indexes to search when no index is specified.
* These indexes can be wild-carded ("*"), with the exception that '*' does not
  match internal indexes.
* To match internal indexes, start with '_'. All internal indexes are
  represented by '_*'.
* The wildcard character '*' is limited to match either all the non-internal 
  indexes or all the internal indexes, but not both at once.
* If you make any changes in the "Indexes searched by default" Settings panel
  for a role in Splunk Web, those values take precedence, and any wildcards
  you specify in this setting are lost.
* Defaults to none.

srchIndexesAllowed = <string>
* Semicolon delimited list of indexes this role is allowed to search
* Follows the same wildcarding semantics as srchIndexesDefault
* If you make any changes in the "Indexes" Settings panel
  for a role in Splunk Web, those values take precedence, and any wildcards
  you specify in this setting are lost.
* Defaults to none.

deleteIndexesAllowed = <string>
* Semicolon delimited list of indexes this role is allowed to delete
* This setting must be used in conjunction with the delete_by_keyword
  capability
* Follows the same wildcarding semantics as srchIndexesDefault
* Defaults to none

cumulativeSrchJobsQuota = <number>
* Maximum number of concurrently running historical searches in total
  across all members of this role
* Requires enable_cumulative_quota = true in limits.conf to take effect.
* If a user belongs to multiple roles, the user's searches count against 
  the role with the largest cumulative search quota. Once the quota for 
  that role is consumed, the user's searches count against the role with 
  the next largest quota, and so on.
* In search head clustering environments, this setting takes effect on a 
  per-member basis. There is no cluster-wide accounting.

cumulativeRTSrchJobsQuota = <number>
* Maximum number of concurrently running real-time searches in total
  across all members of this role
* Requires enable_cumulative_quota = true in limits.conf to take effect.
* If a user belongs to multiple roles, the user's searches count against 
  the role with the largest cumulative search quota. Once the quota for 
  that role is consumed, the user's searches count against the role with 
  the next largest quota, and so on.
* In search head clustering environments, this setting takes effect 
  on a per-member basis. There is no cluster-wide accounting.

### Descriptions of Splunk system capabilities. Capabilities are added to roles, 
 to which users are then assigned. When a user is assigned a role, they acquire 
 the capabilities added to that role.

[capability::accelerate_datamodel]
* Lets a user enable or disable datamodel acceleration.

[capability::accelerate_search]
* Lets a user enable or disable acceleration for reports. 
* The assigned role must also be granted the schedule_search capability.

[capability::run_multi_phased_searches]
* Lets a user in a distributed search environment run searches with 
  three or more map-reduce phases
* Allows users to take advantage of the search performance gains 
  related to parallel reduce functionality. 
* Multiphased searches can lead to higher resource utilization on 
  indexers, but they can also reduce resource utilization on search heads. 

[capability::admin_all_objects]
* Lets a user access all objects in the system, such as user
  objects and knowledge objects.
* Lets a user bypasses any ACL restrictions, much the way root access in 
  a *nix environment does.
