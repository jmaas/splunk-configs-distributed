#   Version 7.1.1
#
# This file contains possible attributes and values for configuring a
# deployment client to receive content (apps and configurations) from a
# deployment server.
#
# To customize the way a deployment client behaves, place a
# deploymentclient.conf in $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local/ on that Splunk
# instance. Configure what apps or configuration content is deployed to a
# given deployment client in serverclass.conf.  Refer to
# serverclass.conf.spec and serverclass.conf.example for more information.
#
# You must restart Splunk for changes to this configuration file to take
# effect.
#
# To learn more about configuration files (including precedence) please see
# the documentation located at
# http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Aboutconfigurationfiles

#***************************************************************************
# Configure a Splunk deployment client.
#
# Note: At a minimum the [deployment-client] stanza is required in
# deploymentclient.conf for deployment client to be enabled.
#***************************************************************************

# GLOBAL SETTINGS
# Use the [default] stanza to define any global settings.
#   * You can also define global settings outside of any stanza, at the top
#     of the file.
#   * Each conf file should have at most one default stanza. If there are
#     multiple default stanzas, attributes are combined. In the case of
#     multiple definitions of the same attribute, the last definition in the
#     file wins.
#   * If an attribute is defined at both the global level and in a specific
#     stanza, the value in the specific stanza takes precedence.

[deployment-client]

disabled = [false|true]
* Defaults to false
* Enable/Disable deployment client.

clientName = deploymentClient
* Defaults to deploymentClient.
* A name that the deployment server can filter on.
* Takes precedence over DNS names.

workingDir = $SPLUNK_HOME/var/run
* Temporary folder used by the deploymentClient to download apps and
  configuration content.

repositoryLocation = $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps
* The location into which content is installed after being downloaded from a
  deployment server.
* Apps and configuration content must be installed into the default location
  ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) or it will not be recognized by
  the Splunk instance on the deployment client.
    * Note: Apps and configuration content to be deployed may be located in
      an alternate location on the deployment server. Set both
      repositoryLocation and serverRepositoryLocationPolicy explicitly to
      ensure that the content is installed into the correct location
      ($SPLUNK_HOME/etc/apps) on the deployment clientr
    * The deployment client uses the 'serverRepositoryLocationPolicy'
      defined below to determine which value of repositoryLocation to use.

serverRepositoryLocationPolicy = [acceptSplunkHome|acceptAlways|rejectAlways]
* Defaults to acceptSplunkHome.
* acceptSplunkHome - accept the repositoryLocation supplied by the
                     deployment server, only if it is rooted by
                     $SPLUNK_HOME.
* acceptAlways - always accept the repositoryLocation supplied by the
                 deployment server.
* rejectAlways - reject the server supplied value and use the
                 repositoryLocation specified in the local
                 deploymentclient.conf.

endpoint=$deploymentServerUri$/services/streams/deployment?name=$serverClassName$:$appName$
* The HTTP endpoint from which content should be downloaded.
* Note: The deployment server may specify a different endpoint from which to
  download each set of content (individual apps, etc).
* The deployment client will use the serverEndpointPolicy defined below to
  determine which value to use.
* $deploymentServerUri$ will resolve to targetUri defined in the
  [target-broker] stanza below.
* $serverClassName$ and $appName$ mean what they say.

serverEndpointPolicy = [acceptAlways|rejectAlways]
* defaults to acceptAlways
* acceptAlways - always accept the endpoint supplied by the server.
* rejectAlways - reject the endpoint supplied by the server. Always use the
                 'endpoint' definition above.

phoneHomeIntervalInSecs = <number in seconds>
* Defaults to 60.
* Fractional seconds are allowed.
* This determines how frequently this deployment client should check for new
  content.

handshakeRetryIntervalInSecs = <number in seconds>
* Defaults to one fifth of phoneHomeIntervalInSecs
* Fractional seconds are allowed.
* This sets the handshake retry frequency.
* Could be used to tune the initial connection rate on a new server

handshakeReplySubscriptionRetry = <integer>
* Defaults to 10
* If splunk is unable to complete the handshake, it will retry subscribing to
  the handshake channel after this many handshake attempts

appEventsResyncIntervalInSecs = <number in seconds>
* Defaults to 10*phoneHomeIntervalInSecs
* Fractional seconds are allowed.
* This sets the interval at which the client reports back its app state to the server.

# Advanced!
# You should use this property only when you have a hierarchical deployment
# server installation, and have a Splunk instance that behaves as both a
# DeploymentClient and a DeploymentServer.

# NOTE: hierarchical deployment servers are not a currently recommended
# configuration.  Splunk has seen problems in the field that have not yet
# been resolved with this type of configuration.

reloadDSOnAppInstall = [false|true]
* Defaults to false
* Setting this flag to true will cause the deploymentServer on this Splunk
  instance to be reloaded whenever an app is installed by this
  deploymentClient.

sslVersions = <versions_list>
* Comma-separated list of SSL versions to connect to the specified Deployment Server
* The versions available are "ssl3", "tls1.0", "tls1.1", and "tls1.2".
* The special version "*" selects all supported versions.  The version "tls"
  selects all versions tls1.0 or newer.
* If a version is prefixed with "-" it is removed from the list.
* SSLv2 is always disabled; "-ssl2" is accepted in the version list but does nothing.
* When configured in FIPS mode, ssl3 is always disabled regardless
  of this configuration.
* Defaults to sslVersions value in server.conf [sslConfig] stanza.

sslVerifyServerCert = <bool>
* If this is set to true, Splunk verifies that the Deployment Server (specified in 'targetUri')
  being connected to is a valid one (authenticated).  Both the common
  name and the alternate name of the server are then checked for a
  match if they are specified in 'sslCommonNameToCheck' and 'sslAltNameToCheck'.
  A certificiate is considered verified if either is matched.
* Defaults to sslVerifyServerCert value in server.conf [sslConfig] stanza.

caCertFile = <path>
* Full path to a CA (Certificate Authority) certificate(s) PEM format file.
* The <path> must refer to a PEM format file containing one or more root CA
  certificates concatenated together.
* Used for validating SSL certificate from Deployment Server
* Defaults to caCertFile value in server.conf [sslConfig] stanza.

sslCommonNameToCheck = <commonName1>, <commonName2>, ...
* If this value is set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
  splunkd checks the common name(s) of the certificate presented by
  the Deployment Server (specified in 'targetUri') against this list of common names.
* Defaults to sslCommonNameToCheck value in server.conf [sslConfig] stanza.

sslAltNameToCheck =  <alternateName1>, <alternateName2>, ...
* If this value is set, and 'sslVerifyServerCert' is set to true,
  splunkd checks the alternate name(s) of the certificate presented by
  the Deployment Server (specified in 'targetUri') against this list of subject alternate names.
* Defaults to sslAltNameToCheck value in server.conf [sslConfig] stanza.

cipherSuite = <cipher suite string>
* If set, uses the specified cipher string for making outbound HTTPS connection.

ecdhCurves = <comma separated list of ec curves>
* ECDH curves to use for ECDH key negotiation.
* The curves should be specified in the order of preference.
* The client sends these curves as a part of Client Hello.
* We only support named curves specified by their SHORT names.
  (see struct ASN1_OBJECT in asn1.h)
* The list of valid named curves by their short/long names can be obtained
  by executing this command:
  $SPLUNK_HOME/bin/splunk cmd openssl ecparam -list_curves
* Default is empty string.
* e.g. ecdhCurves = prime256v1,secp384r1,secp521r1

# The following stanza specifies deployment server connection information

[target-broker:deploymentServer]

targetUri= <uri>
* An example of <uri>: <scheme>://<deploymentServer>:<mgmtPort>
* URI of the deployment server.

phoneHomeIntervalInSecs = <nonnegative number>
* see phoneHomeIntervalInSecs above
